## Who wants some CSS Power?!

All those margin and padding we've been doing to move things/items around, what if there was  a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic...hmmm...

There is! It's called [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) .

In this project we will get CSS power from the Powerpuff Girls using flexbox to pose them. We will provide the html file on the [github](https://github.com/mesuara/power-pose-girls) repo and all you have to do is clone it and adjust the css file.

Let's get to work! Remember we will be using flexbox for _all_ of our divs and there will be some css included on the start up code. And make it look like [this website](https://abbreviatedman.github.io/power-pose-girls-solution/)
